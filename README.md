# CustomizeYourExperienceOnline
We live in a digital age of too many options, where everywhere you go corporations are trying to squeeze you for every penny. It can be difficult, in these circumstances, to know what options may be better than others. Here I intend to list applications, plugins, extensions, scripts, and various other bits of tech that I personally utilize and highly recommend. But, the idea is to get you on the lookout for what you specifically would like to use for yourself. I've always been a big advocate of designing the way you interact with the internet, customizing it as much as you can to fit exactly how you want to use it. Hopefully this readme will provide some useful tips.

## Overview
Whilst I will be sharing names and links to specific things here, I will not make an active effort to update said links and names. If a program I recommend goes offline or is otherwise taken down, tough luck. 

Additionally, I will not be advocating directly for piracy here. Whilst I personally believe that piracy is moral most the time in the current age of the internet, lawyers would disagree with me. Whilst I personally believe it can be a necessity in this day and age, I won't be telling you how to pirate. Any programs I share that may be used for the act of piracy are being shared under the guise of educational purposes. It is ultimately up to the end user to decide if that is right for them.

### Browsers
It seems nowadays that you are mostly stuck with, most likely, google chrome. Some people use edge, some people use safari, but broadly speaking most of the internet is using chrome. Chrome is not a favorable browser to me personally, and I will talk about my reasons for choosing other browsers below.
1. Chrome is entirely helmed by Google, tracker central as I like to think of them. Your privacy is as good as gone as long as you are using chrome.
2. Chrome lacks features that other browsers have
3. Chrome is reallllly rough on memory. 

So, what are some better options? Glad you asked.
- The main browser I use is [vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). This has some of the better UI of the other major competitors, has likely the most built in customization of any other major browser, and being built on chromium has competibility with chrome based extensions. I utilize duckduckgo as the search engine for both regular tabs and private tabs. The major con to all these pros is that vivaldi too, can be resources intensive. For my computer and for my friends computers, its been fine, but if you are running into resource issues, consider a different browser. Another thing to note is that vivaldi is made by the initial developers for opera browser, who left opera to make vivaldi. Opera does have some similarities with vivaldi, but between the two, vivaldi is much better by a landslide.
- There is also [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Firefox is less resource intensive, more open for developers, not built on chromium, generally has a pretty good UI. It does lack some of the customization that vivaldi does, but this is a solid alternative option that I would recommend people try. It does not natively support chrome extensions, but does have a seperate extension "marketplace", where you can get firefox specific extensions.
